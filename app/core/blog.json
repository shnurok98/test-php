            "body": "<p>IndexBox has just published a new report: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indexbox.io\/store\/eu-wheat-gluten-market-analysis-forecast-size-trends-and-insights\/\">'EU - Wheat Gluten - Market Analysis, Forecast, Size, Trends And Insights'<\/a>. Here is a summary of the report's key findings.<\/p><p>In 2019, the EU wheat gluten market increased by 4.9% to $932M for the first time since 2015, thus ending a three-year declining trend. Over the period under review, consumption saw a relatively flat trend pattern. The level of consumption peaked at $1,000M in 2015; however, from 2016 to 2019, consumption remained at a lower figure.<\/p><p>The countries with the highest volumes of wheat gluten consumption in 2019 were France (128K tonnes), Germany (112K tonnes) and the Netherlands (80K tonnes), together comprising 48% of total consumption. The UK, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Sweden lagged somewhat behind, together comprising a further 41%.<\/p><p>From 2014 to 2019, the biggest increases were in Sweden, while wheat gluten consumption for the other leaders experienced more modest paces of growth.<\/p><p>In value terms, France ($191M), the Netherlands ($116M) and Germany ($101M) constituted the countries with the highest levels of market value in 2019, together comprising 44% of the total market. These countries were followed by the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Greece, which together accounted for a further 42%.<\/p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a noticeable transformation of the markets in the EU, in particular, with regard to the wheat gluten market. So far, the uncertainty regarding the depth of both the European and the national economic decline is too great to make long-term forecasts. As wheat gluten constitute a common input in the production of bread and bakery, pasta, and some other food products, which are, in turn, consumer-targeted. Therefore, the pandemic brought changes to key market fundamentals: macroeconomic background, sales channels, supply chains, consumer behavior, and prices.<\/p><p>Against the backdrop of the introduction of quarantine restrictions which lead to the closure of production, a halt in transport activity, and a drop in incomes, over March-April of 2020 many countries experienced a booming consumer demand for long-term storage food products, including pasta. Against this backdrop, a noticeable increase in grain milling output was observed in March-April, also boosted by the disruption of pasta supply chains from Italy. This may affect local demand for wheat gluten, however, since pasta is largely made from durum wheat rich in natural gluten, no dramatic structural changes are expected in the market, although local fluctuations are possible. Further supply chain operations depend on the development of the virus situation, which is still highly uncertain, with the possible threat of the so-called \u2018second wave\u2019 of the pandemic.<\/p><p>Given the limitations of the HoReCa sector and the reduced number of visits to traditional malls and shops, the bread output fell dramatically across Europe, which certainly affects the demand for flours. This, however, was partially mitigated by the rising demand for flour for the production of pasta outside Italy, and the rising demand for ingredients for home baking.<\/p><p>As the wheat gluten market is predominantly a b2b-market, no dramatic changes are expected with regard to sales channels. However, online communication becomes increasingly important even in the b2b sales channels, with the use of distant negotiations and electronic document workflow.<\/p><p>The major risk in sales channels comes from the disruption of established international supply chains between wheat growers, importers, wheat processors, distributors, and bakeries\/pasta producers due to asynchronous quarantine measures and restricted transport activity. &nbsp;<\/p><p>In March-April 2020, there was a noticeable increase in consumer prices for bread, flour, and pasta in many large consumer countries. This growth, however, was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in producer prices, which indicates the rush demand as the main reason for the price increase. Thus, producer prices rise slightly in Spain and France, in Italy they grew sharply from April to June, while in Germany, the prices also saw an increase from April to June, but it was less tangible than in Italy. From July to August, the producer prices in almost all of the countries stabilized, except for Italy which saw another hike in terms of grain milling producer prices. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Consequently, the crisis of the COVID pandemic does not yet lead to a significant increase in prices, and the market is trying to find a new balance. Further price dynamics will depend on the situation with wheat supplies and the degree of threat of a new wave of quarantine restrictions. However, since some transport and cross-border restrictions still remain, local small price fluctuations are possible due to the current supply and demand conditions.<\/p><p>In 2019, the amount of wheat gluten imported in the European Union declined dramatically to 330K tonnes, waning by -16.8% in 2018. Overall, imports recorded a slight decline. In value terms, wheat gluten imports fell rapidly to $504M (<a href=\"https:\/\/app.indexbox.io\/report?product=1109&amp;region=155\">IndexBox estimates<\/a>) in 2019.<\/p><p>The wheat gluten import price in the European Union stood at $1,526 per tonne in 2019, waning by -7% against the previous year. The growth pace was the most rapid in 2018 when the import price increased by 10% year-to-year. As a result, import price attained the peak level of $1,640 per tonne, and then reduced in the following year.<\/p><p>Average prices varied somewhat amongst the major importing countries. In 2019, major importing countries recorded the following prices: in France ($1,692 per tonne) and Denmark ($1,644 per tonne), while Spain ($1,343 per tonne) and Poland ($1,417 per tonne) were amongst the lowest.<\/p><p>The wheat gluten imports in the EU experienced a sharp contraction since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, which went along with a sharp drop in average import prices. This generally corresponds to the growth in domestic production in the same period - due to the undermining of supply chains, more grain mill products began to be produced domestically. In the third quarter of 2020, however, both the prices and the volumes of import prices recovered to their previous level, which was due to the gradual stabilization of the market amid the opening of the economy.<\/p><p>Local fluctuations in supply and prices are possible due to risks in the supply chain and macroeconomic uncertainty. Weather conditions also act as an uncertainty factor for wheat supply in 2020<\/p><p>Given the pandemic-related limitation of the HoReCa and retail sector, the wheat gluten market is not expected to post any tangible gains in 2020. Afterward, the market is forecast to resume gradual growth, driven by gradual population growth and the recovery of the baking industry. Market performance is forecast to retain its current trend pattern, expanding with an anticipated CAGR of +0.7% for the period from 2019 to 2030, which is projected to bring the market volume to 725K tonnes by the end of 2030.<\/p>",

Rapid urbanization, rising consumer incomes, as well as the increasing popularity of Western-style cuisine and fast-food in large cities all constitute the key prerequisites for the growing demand for imported beer.&nbsp;<\/p><h4>Imports by Country<\/h4><p>China represented the main importer of beer made from malt (excluding non-alcoholic beer) in Asia-Pacific, with the volume of imports resulting at 836K tonnes, which was near 31% of total imports in 2019. It was distantly followed by Australia (383K tonnes), South Korea (372K tonnes), Taiwan (Chinese) (194K tonnes), Myanmar (151K tonnes), Hong Kong SAR (147K tonnes) and Singapore (139K tonnes), together creating a 51% share of total imports.<\/p><p>China was also the fastest-growing in terms of the beer made from malt (excluding non-alcoholic beer) imports, with a CAGR of +28.5% from 2013 to 2019. At the same time, South Korea (+22.4%), Taiwan (Chinese) (+4.5%) and Australia (+3.6%) displayed positive paces of growth. Hong Kong SAR and Myanmar experienced a relatively flat trend pattern. By contrast, Singapore (-3.9%) illustrated a downward trend over the same period.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, in 2019, the growth of Chinese beer imports lost its momentum, which is largely attributed to a slowdown in the economy, rising political tensions and the expansion of the domestic beer industry. In 2020, it is not expected that import should recover because the COVID pandemic hit severely the HoReCa sector, hampered the growth of incomes, and to some extent disrupted international supply chains.&nbsp;<\/p><p>After the pandemic wanes, it may be difficult for foreign brands to recover their market presence against local manufacturers which rapidly take every vacant market segment. This is particularly relevant for large cities where Western ex-pats commonly live - the rising trade wars undermine the growth of foreign business in China thereby the number of foreign citizens working in China is not likely to grow tangibly. Because those people shape the demand for imported beer, the growth of imports is to be hampered by these circumstances.<\/p><p>In value terms, China ($909M) constitutes the largest market for imported beer made from malt (excluding non-alcoholic beer) in Asia-Pacific, comprising 36% of total imports. The second position in the ranking was occupied by Australia ($359M), with a 14% share of total imports.

Analysis And Forecast to 2025'<\/a>. Here is a summary of the report's key findings.<\/p><p>After six years of growth, the U.S. wood window and door market decreased by -2.1% to $12.2B in 2019. The market value increased at an average annual rate of +3.5% over the period from 2013 to 2019; the trend pattern remained consistent throughout the analyzed period. The growth pace was the most rapid in 2015 with an increase of 8.3% year-to-year. Wood window and door consumption peaked at $12.5B in 2018 and then dropped slightly in the following year.<\/p><p>The growth of the construction sector was the main driver behind the growth of the wood window and door market. Prior to 2020, construction in the U.S. grew robustly, driven by the rising economy, disposable incomes and the availability of loans. In early 2020, the global economy entered a period of the crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to battle the spread of the virus, most countries in the world implemented quarantine measures that put on halt production and transport activity.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The combination of those factors disrupted economic growth heavily throughout the world. According to World Bank forecasts, despite the gradual relaxing of restrictive measures and unprecedented government support in countries that faced the pandemic in early 2020, the annual decline of global GDP could amount to -5.2%, which is the deepest global recession being seen over the past eight decades.<\/p><p>The U.S. is also facing a drastic short-term recession, with the expected contraction of GDP of approx. -6.1% in 2020, being hit by the pandemic harder than expected, with unemployment increasing due to the shutdown and social isolation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The construction sector has proven extremely vulnerable to the pandemic. Thus, the above economic prerequisites will have the most negative impact on the production of building materials, and, therefore, on the consumption of wooden windows and doors. Thus, due to quarantine measures, construction projects were paused, and the drop in incomes of the population makes mortgage loans less affordable.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Moreover, the reduced capital investment may lead to the postponement of plans for the building new and the renewal of the existing dwellings, infrastructural and industrial facilities. In addition, the disruption of established international supply chains between wooden windows and doors producers and consumers due to asynchronous quarantine measures and restricted transport activity.<\/p><p>In the medium term, should the pandemic outbreak end in the second half of 2020, the economy is to start recovering in 2021 and then return to the market trend of the gradual growth, driven by the fundamentals existed before 2020 and boosted by support measures imposed by the government. Accordingly, the American wood window and door market is to drop by approx. 6% in 2020 and then to start growing gradually. However, those projections are very vulnerable to the possible second wave of the COVID epidemic.<\/p><h4>Production of Wood Window and Door in the U.S.<\/h4><p>In value terms, wood window and door production fell slightly to $11.6B in 2019.

            "body": "<p>IndexBox has just published a new report: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indexbox.io\/store\/world-pistachios-market-report-analysis-and-forecast-to-2020\/\">'World - Pistachios - Market Analysis, Forecast, Size, Trends and Insights'<\/a>. Here is a summary of the report's key findings.<\/p><p>The global pistachio market expanded slightly to $10.6B in 2019, growing by 4% against the previous year. This figure reflects the total revenues of producers and importers (excluding logistics costs, retail marketing costs, and retailers' margins, which will be included in the final consumer price). In general, consumption showed resilient growth, driven by both the increases in prices and in the volume of consumption in physical terms.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Pistachios are a well-known product in the Middle East and in the U.S. where they are largely grown. Being imported, the product is also widely consumed worldwide. &nbsp;Thus, the countries with the highest volumes of pistachio consumption in 2019 were Iran (490K tonnes), Turkey (263K tonnes) and the U.S. (255K tonnes), with a combined 67% share of global consumption.<\/p><p>From 2013 to 2019, the biggest increases were in Iran, while pistachio consumption for the other global leaders experienced more modest paces of growth.<\/p><p>In value terms, the largest pistachio markets worldwide were Iran ($3.7B), the U.S. ($2B) and Turkey ($1.6B), with a combined 69% share (<a href=\"https:\/\/app.indexbox.io\/report?product=080251&amp;region=0\">IndexBox estimates<\/a>) of the global market.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The countries with the highest levels of pistachio per capita consumption in 2019 were Iran (5.90 kg per person), Turkey (3.18 kg per person) and Hong Kong SAR (3.12 kg per person).<\/p><p>Like other nuts, pistachios are consumed primarily as a snack. In addition, thanks to its distinctive taste, flavor and color, those nuts are widely used in pistachio-flavored products, in a bid to benefit on flavor. The changing consumer lifestyle, rapid urbanization and increasing disposable incomes promote the demand for on-the-go healthy convenience foods and snacks which includes pistachios. Moreover, the nuts also are recognized by vegan and highly health-conscious consumers.<\/p><p>Accordingly, population growth remains a fundamental market driver, combined with increases in disposable income, which in turn will contribute to enhanced consumer spending. Increasing preference for healthy food and rising health awareness is also supporting the pistachio market growth.<\/p><p>Until 2020, the global economy has been developing steadily for five years, which created a favorable environment for the pistachio market growth. In early 2020, however, the global economy entered a period of the crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to battle the spread of the virus, most countries in the world implemented quarantine measures that put on halt production and transport activity, which undermined economic growth heavily throughout the world.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In the context of falling incomes, consumers primarily tend to exclude non-staple goods from purchases, which include pistachios. Thus, a sharp drop in household incomes is a powerful factor that will restrain the pistachios market in the medium term. In addition, the closure of the HoReCa sector limits the growth in the consumption of pistachios as ingredients for various foods and snacks.<\/p><p>In the countries of the Middle East, where pistachios are locally available and are staple food products, the impact of the crisis on domestic demand should be less significant. At the same time, the pistachios industry in large producing countries (the U.S., Iran, Turkey) is largely export-oriented, therefore, a decrease in demand in non-producing countries can hurt local producers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Given the above-mentioned prerequisites, the global pistachio market is expected to contract somewhat in 2020 and then to begin a slow growth on the backdrop of a gradual recovery of the global economy from the pandemic. In the medium term, the market is expected to grow modestly, with an anticipated CAGR of +1.1% for the period from 2019 to 2030, which is projected to bring the market volume to 1.7M tonnes by the end of 2030.<\/p><h4>Production<\/h4><p>In 2019, approx. 1.5M tonnes of pistachios were produced worldwide; growing by 8.1% compared with 2018. Over the period under review, the total production indicated a prominent expansion from 2013 to 2019: its volume increased at an average annual rate of +13.8% over the last six-year period. The generally positive trend in terms of pistachio output was largely conditioned by the strong growth of the harvested area and a buoyant expansion in yield figures.<\/p><p>The countries with the highest volumes of pistachio production in 2019 were Iran (571K tonnes), the U.S. (484K tonnes) and Turkey (267K tonnes), together accounting for 88% of global production.<\/p><h4>Harvested Area and Yield<\/h4><p>In 2019, the global harvested area of pistachios rose rapidly to 804K ha, increasing by 6.6% against 2018 figures. The harvested area increased at an average annual rate of +5.7% over the period from 2013 to 2019. In 2019, the global average pistachio yield amounted to 1.9 tonnes per ha, stabilizing at the previous year's figure. Over the period under review, the yield indicated resilient growth from 2013 to 2019: its figure increased at an average annual rate of +7.7% over the last six-year period.<\/p><h4>Imports<\/h4><p>In 2019, approx. 439K tonnes of pistachios were imported worldwide; surging by 15% compared with the previous year's figure. The total import volume increased at an average annual rate of +3.2% over the period from 2013 to 2019. In value terms, pistachio imports rose significantly to $3.4B (<a href=\"https:\/\/app.indexbox.io\/report?product=080251&amp;region=0\">IndexBox estimates<\/a>) in 2019.&nbsp;<\/p><h4>Imports by Country<\/h4><p>In 2019, China (113K tonnes), distantly followed by Hong Kong SAR (65K tonnes), Germany (45K tonnes) and India (23K tonnes) were the largest importers of pistachios, together constituting 56% of total imports. Italy (18K tonnes), Belgium (15K tonnes), Spain (15K tonnes), Russia (10K tonnes), Saudi Arabia (10K tonnes), Israel (9.8K tonnes), Luxembourg (8.5K tonnes) and France (8.3K tonnes) occupied a little share of total imports.<\/p><p>From 2013 to 2019, the most notable rate of growth in terms of purchases, amongst the main importing countries, was attained by China, while imports for the other global leaders experienced more modest paces of growth.<\/p><p>In value terms, the largest pistachio importing markets worldwide were China ($809M), Hong Kong SAR ($496M) and Germany ($436M), with a combined 51% share of global imports.<\/p><h4>Import Prices by Country<\/h4><p>In 2019, the average pistachio import price amounted to $7,794 per tonne, falling by -2.4% against the previous year. Global import price peaked at $8,208 per tonne in 2015; however, from 2016 to 2019, import prices stood at a somewhat lower figure.<\/p><p>There were significant differences in the average prices amongst the major importing countries. In 2019, the country with the highest price was Italy ($10,948 per tonne), while Israel ($4,799 per tonne) was amongst the lowest.<\/p>",

            "body": "<p>IndexBox invites everyone interested in the relevant data and the actual trends regarding the global silica sand market to join our webinar: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indexbox.io\/events\/global-natural-sand-market-2020\/\">'Global Silica Sand Market - Statistics, Trends, and Outlook'<\/a>. Here is a summary of the webinar's key findings.<\/p><h4>The Global Silica Sand Market Posted Solid Gains Until being Hit by the Pandemic<\/h4><p>For the third consecutive year, the global silica sand market recorded growth in sales value, which increased by 7.7% to $52.4B in 2019 (<a href=\"https:\/\/app.indexbox.io\/report?product=250510&amp;region=0\">IndexBox estimates<\/a>). The market value increased at an average annual rate of +2.0% over the period from 2007 to 2019.<\/p><p>The countries with the highest volumes of silica sand consumption in 2019 were China (123M tonnes), the U.S. (105M tonnes) and Brazil (20M tonnes), with a combined 51% share of global consumption. Turkey, the Netherlands, India, Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Poland and Germany lagged somewhat behind, together comprising a further 20%. In value terms, the U.S. ($7.6B) led the market, alone. The second position in the ranking was occupied by Brazil ($2.1B). It was followed by Italy.<\/p><p>The main applications of quartz sand are the glass industry, cement production, steel castings manufacturing, production of building materials, production of welding materials, porcelain production, water treatment systems, as an abrasive material for sandblasting, etc. Due to the fact that the scope of quartz sand use is very extensive, the general state of the economy, which is expressed in the growth of GDP, as well as the state of key consuming industries, including construction, constitute the fundamental factors behind the market growth.<\/p><p>It is the construction sector that shapes the consumption of many products and materials, which include quartz sand (dry building mixtures, floorings, cement, mortars, etc.). In addition, the demand in the glass industry, water treatment, and, to a certain extent, metallurgy is also associated with the construction sector.<\/p><p>Until 2020, the global economy has been developing steadily for five years, although at a slower pace than in the previous decade. According to the World Bank outlook from January 2020, the global economy was expected to pick up the growth momentum and increase by from +2.5% to +2.7% per year in the medium term. The main driver of growth in the global economy was the growing demand from developing countries, mainly China and the countries of Southeast Asia. In these countries the economic growth rates are the highest in the world, which is accompanied by active urbanization and growth of the population's income; all this together leads to an expansion of the volume of both industry and construction. In the United States and the EU, economic growth was also high, which was due to both the strong employment and the availability of credit funding.<\/p><p>In early 2020, however, the global economy entered a period of the crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to battle the spread of the virus, most countries in the world implemented quarantine measures that put on halt production and transport activity. &nbsp;<\/p><p>The combination of those factors disrupted economic growth heavily throughout the world. According to World Bank forecasts, despite the gradual relaxing of restrictive measures and unprecedented government support in countries that faced the pandemic in early 2020, the annual decline of global GDP could amount to -5.2%, which is the deepest global recession being seen over the past eight decades.<\/p><p>In Asian countries, especially China, which faced the pandemic earlier than others, the epidemic situation improved earlier, with the quarantine measures largely relaxed, and the economy is gradually recovering from the forced outage. Thus, in China, by the end of 2020, an increase of 1% is expected (while a year earlier it was 6.1%), and in general in Southeast Asia in 2020, an increase of 0.5% is expected. In the medium term, it is assumed that the economy will gradually recover over several years as the restrictions are finally lifted. &nbsp;<\/p><p>The U.S., meanwhile, is struggling with a drastic short-term recession, with the expected contraction of GDP of approx. -6.1% in 2020, as the hit of the pandemic was harder than expected, and unemployment soared due to the shutdown and social isolation. In Japan, the decline is also expected to be deep, with -6.1% in 2020, which also hampers any growth of the construction sector. &nbsp;<\/p><p>According to the European Commission, the EU economy is forecasted to plummet by -8.3% in 2020 on the backdrop of the pandemic, hampered by the lockdown, a drop in consumer spending and decreased investment. Russia is also struggling with a sensitive short-term recession, with the expected contraction of GDP of approx. -6.0% in 2020. Current short-term indicators show that the plunge in the first half of 2020 was really deep, but a gradual recovery starts in the third quarter of 2020.<\/p><p>This unpreceded drop of the global economy should certainly affect the silica sand market which is to a very high extent bound to the construction sector.<\/p><h4>The COVID Pandemic Challenged the Market, Hampering the Growth and Disrupting Supply Chains<\/h4><p>The construction sector has proven extremely vulnerable to the pandemic. Thus, the above economic prerequisites will have the most negative impact on the production of building materials, and, therefore, on the consumption of silica sand. The negative challenge for the market is that due to quarantine measures, construction projects were paused, and the drop in incomes of the population makes mortgage loans less affordable. Moreover, reduced capital investments may lead to the postponement of plans for the building new and the renewal of the existing dwellings, infrastructural and industrial facilities.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In addition, the disruption of established international supply chains between silica sand producers and consumers due to asynchronous quarantine measures and restricted transport activity. Silica sands exports expanded modestly to $1.2B (<a href=\"https:\/\/app.indexbox.io\/report?product=250510&amp;region=0\">IndexBox estimates<\/a>) in 2019, with the U.S. ($375M), Australia ($205M) and Belgium ($96M) featuring among the top exporters, together accounting for 54% of global exports.&nbsp;The total export value increased at an average annual rate of +3.1% over the period from 2007 to 2019. In 2020, expectations regarding the dynamic of global trade are cautious, as it may stagnate along with global consumption.&nbsp;<\/p><p>On the other hand, lower oil prices as a result of reduced demand and oversupply amid the pandemic are making oil and gas more affordable. Consequently, the cost of construction materials incorporating silica is to decrease, which should partially mitigate the negative effect of the drop in spending and investments. Increasing urbanization, as well as the expansion of the suburbs of large metropolitan areas (especially in developed countries), are driving an increase in demand for construction products for individual housing and water treatment, which is also to support the demand for silica sand.<\/p><p>In the medium term, should the pandemic outbreak end in the second half of 2020, the economy is to start recovering in 2021 and then return to the market trend of the gradual growth, driven by the fundamentals existed before 2020 and boosted by support measures imposed by the government. After the ease of the quarantine shutdown, a recovery in the global economy began by the end of the 2nd quarter of 2020.
